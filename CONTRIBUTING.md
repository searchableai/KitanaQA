How to contribute to KitanaQA?
Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code is thus not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping others, reaching out and improving the documentations are immensely valuable to the community.

It also helps us if you spread the word: reference the library from blog posts on the awesome projects it made possible, shout out on Twitter every time it has helped you, or simply star the repo to say "thank you".

You can contribute in so many ways!

There are 4 ways you can contribute to KitanaQA:

Fixing outstanding issues with the existing code;
Implementing new models;
Contributing to the examples or to the documentation;
Submitting issues related to bugs or desired new features.
All are equally valuable to the community.

Submitting a new issue or feature request
Do your best to follow these guidelines when submitting an issue or a feature request. It will make it easier for us to come back to you quickly and with good feedback.

Did you find a bug?

Our goal is to keep KitanaQA robust and reliable thanks to the users who notify us of the problems they encounter. So thank you for reporting an issue.

First, we would really appreciate it if you could make sure the bug was not already reported (use the search bar on Github under Issues).

Did not find it? :( So we can act quickly on it, please follow these steps:

Include your OS type and version, the versions of Python, PyTorch and Tensorflow when applicable;
A short, self-contained, code snippet that allows us to reproduce the bug in less than 30s;

Do you want to implement a new model?
Awesome! Please provide the following information:

Short description of the model and link to the paper;
Link to the implementation if it is open-source;
Link to the model weights if they are available.
If you are willing to contribute the model yourself, let us know so we can best guide you.

Do you want a new feature (that is not a model)?
A world-class feature request addresses the following points:

Motivation first:
Is it related to a problem/frustration with the library? If so, please explain why. Providing a code snippet that demonstrates the problem is best.
Is it related to something you would need for a project? We'd love to hear about it!
Is it something you worked on and think could benefit the community? Awesome! Tell us what problem it solved for you.
Write a full paragraph describing the feature;
Provide a code snippet that demonstrates its future use;
In case this is related to a paper, please attach a link;
Attach any additional information (drawings, screenshots, etc.) you think may help.
If your issue is well written we're already 80% of the way there by the time you post it.

Start contributing! (Pull Requests)
Before writing code, we strongly advise you to search through the exising PRs or issues to make sure that nobody is already working on the same thing. If you are unsure, it is always a good idea to open an issue to get some feedback.

You will need basic git proficiency to be able to contribute to transformers. git is not the easiest tool to use but it has the greatest manual. Type git --help in a shell and enjoy. If you prefer books, Pro Git is a very good reference.

Follow these steps to start contributing:

Fork the repository by clicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code under your GitHub user account.

Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote:
